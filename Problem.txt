Write an application that has an array of at least 20 integers. It should call a method that uses the sequential search algorithm to locate one of the values. The method should keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes until it finds the value. Then the program should call another method that uses the binary search algorithm to locate the same value. It should also keep count of the number of comparisons it makes. Display these values on the screen.
